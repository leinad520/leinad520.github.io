              Hi, I'm Daniel. Some call me Sangyoon. I was born in the U.S., but
              spent most of my life in South Korea üá∞üá∑ and Singapore üá∏üá¨.
              <br /><br />
              On my
              <a href="https://dksangyoon.substack.com" target="_blank"
                >Substack</a
              >
              ‚úçüèº, I write about fundamental investing. Topics include
              philosophies and observations, as well as my positions in crypto
              venture, technology stocks, or value stocks (largely small cap
              net-nets), all through the lens of concentrated value investing.
              Occasionally interspersed are tidbits of my personal life.
              <br /><br />
              Working in venture capital, I've been fortunate to observe
              innovative businesses from the earliest stages. As a bootstrapped
              founder, I've achieved a 7-figure outcome and raised venture
              funding for another.
              <br /><br />
              When I'm not going down rabbit-holes and writing, you can find me
              playing tennis üéæ or golf ‚õ≥ with friends. When I'm alone, I love
              playing Chopin or movie soundtracks on the piano üéπ, though I need
              to start learning some new pieces again. I enjoy trying new types
              of coffee ‚òï (I was a Starbucks barista in my teens), and aim to
              be half-vegetarian, since I'm not brave enough to go full-on just
              yet. <br /><br />
              That's a little bit about me. But if you'd like to learn more
              about how I got here in the first place, come join me below.

            <p style="margin-top: 1rem; margin-bottom: 0">
              Ever since taking a summer camp course in middle school called
              "Who is Dow Jones?", I fell in love with the art of investing.
              Some say investing is the last liberal art. I particularly enjoy
              that it rewards independent, contrarian thinking and an even
              temperament. I chose to attend NYU Stern for their undergraduate
              finance program, but deferred by a year to take a value investing
              course and pore through books like "The Intelligent Investor" at
              the local library. <br /><br />
              During college, I took advantage of being in NYC to intern at
              three different hedge funds, grateful that such institutions would
              even take a student who knew nothing like me. After graduating, I
              started as an investment banking analyst. In some ways, I was
              living the life - early 20s in the heart of New York, exploring
              hobbies, and hosting poker games in our apartment with my two
              housemates.
              <br /><br />
              We also found ourselves chained to our desks on many weekends.
              While banking was touted to be a good stepping stone to greater
              things, I didn't see how it was making me a better investor,
              particularly a long-term investor hoping to build real businesses.
              It was in the midst of this environment, wondering what more there
              was to life, that I discovered cryptocurrencies.
              <br /><br />
              <span class="horizontal-bar"></span>
              <br />
              Long story short, I started arbitraging inefficient crypto
              markets. This was 2017 when the market was rife with
              inefficiencies.
              <br /><br />
              <span>
                <blockquote style="margin-bottom: 0">
                  At the time, crypto was booming. Booming so much that there
                  was a 30-50% spread between Korean and American crypto prices.
                  The opportunity was so blatant that everybody was talking
                  about it, yet nobody thought to actually trade it. Why? I
                  don't know. I asked a lot of people, and they didn't think it
                  was possible because of this regulation or that blocker.
                  <br /><br />
                  With a little investigation, I sorted out the legal and trade
                  mechanics and was making $15,000 every single day, with just a
                  few clicks. This was possible because I identified the
                  opportunities, stayed abreast of developments, moved fast,
                  managed risk, and pulled all-nighters to do the grunt work
                  from talking to lawyers to setting up trades ‚Äî all while
                  working a 70-80 hour / week job‚Ä¶ <br /><br />
                  After this interesting incident, a few friends and I decided
                  to arbitrage the price differentials among exchanges... The
                  trading was run from our tiny NYC bedroom, with rotating
                  sleeping schedules to keep an eye on the markets 24/7. At one
                  point, our portfolios were worth a couple million dollars. It
                  was unbelievable for 23-year-olds whose bank accounts had
                  never seen anything remotely like it. Needless to say, it was
                  an exciting time. -

              I felt empowered - that I too could pave a path in this world
              following my own beliefs, and that it was ok to be different.
              <br /><br />
              But I wanted to do more.
              <br /><br />
              The best in the space were engaged in a movement, not just
              profiting off market inefficiencies. I packed up, said goodbye to
              friends in New York City, my home of five years, and left my old
              life behind.
              <br /><br />
              I would move to the Bay Area in 2018, at age 24, to write a book
              and make a Wikipedia for crypto. Hundreds of projects with
              technical jargon were popping up every day, where even someone
              full-time like myself would get lost in it all. I wanted to help
              people cut through the noise and understand why this technology
              mattered.
              <span class="image main"

              /></span>

              To me, crypto is an equalizing force. Imagine every time you rode
              an Uber, you earned equity in the company. That's a small example
              of what crypto rails make possible. On Ethereum, you can access
              loans from a decentralized protocol with just an internet
              connection, not gated by income, ethnicity, or social status. With
              DePIN systems like Helium, I am both a consumer and owner in the
              mobile network I use.
              <br /><br />
              <span class="horizontal-bar"></span>
              <br />
              By good fortune, mutual connections put me in touch with venture
              capitalist Tim Draper. I thought he was the most down to earth,
              fun investor I'd ever seen, and wanted to learn everything I could
              from him. For context, he was a billionaire VC and founder of
              venture capital firm DFJ, and presently, Draper Associates. As it
              pertains to crypto, he made news for buying the 30,000 bitcoins
              from the Silk Road government auction in 2014, being one of the
              first prominent figures to lend credibility to the space.
              <br /><br />
              Under him, I invested early in projects like Arkham, which
              increased the transparency of murky on-chain transactions, and the
              investment would grow 100x within a couple years of investing. Or
              Polymarket, which I saw go from an experimental project to
              becoming the leading arbiter of truth, especially in the 2024 US
              election. I supported them because they were both founded by
              college dropouts that reminded me of my wiki-building days. We all
              strived to build tools that educated and gave greater opportunity
              to anyone with an internet connection.
              <br /><br />
              Others, like MakerDAO, would enable more people to access loans or
              lending opportunities through its decentralized protocol. And of
              course, there were more established companies like Coinbase and
              Ledger, whom I had the privilege to watch as an investor, the
              former which would IPO at a $100 billion valuation.
              <br /><br />
              Paradoxically over time, I felt simultaneously more involved and
              more on the sidelines. I missed being a player on the field.

              To wrap up my years of self-taught programming, I
              <a
                href="https://dksangyoon.substack.com/p/leaving-vc-coding-bootcamp-startup-55d94fb710ff"
                target="_blank"
                >did a coding bootcamp</a
              >
              (three months of living and breathing code), after which some old
              friends convinced me to co-found a startup with them. One had sold
              his last startup to Bitgo, and was itching to do something new.
              <br /><br />
              I'd happily raise the funding, but on two conditions - that I
              would work as a full-time software engineer, and be off to
              business school after helping them get to the series A. Why
              school? I knew I wanted to eventually work in investing where
              school would be a good transition point, plus you only live once
              so why not.
              <br /><br />
              Luckily, I round up $3.7M in one month, after which the funding
              market swiftly crashed. It was very lucky timing. I was grateful
              to have entrepreneurs I respected like the founders of Youtube,
              Twitch, OrangeDAO (Y-Combinator spinoff for crypto) and many
              others as investors.
              <br /><br />
              We built a prototype of a multi-signature wallet and won 1st place
              in a hackathon hosted by Coinbase and Stripe. Unlike existing
              multisig wallets, you could connect to any dapp through the
              browser. Some companies were interested in acquiring the
              technology and having us build in-house. See
              <a href="https://dksangyoon.com/#code" target="_blank">Code</a>
              section for more on Nest.
              <br /><br />
              My co-founder then pivoted the business into an altcoin-trading
              wallet ‚Äî the third sudden change in direction. Disagreeing, I
              left, as did the CTO. Because the company was small yet
              profitable, he sought full control and attempted to restructure
              ownership, diluting us to near zero. I was able to legally block
              this, but he later relaunched the company under a new name to take
              entire ownership. At that point, I decided to let it go. While it
              wasn‚Äôt the ending I hoped for, the experience taught me some
              invaluable lessons - to evaluate partners' ethics early on, and to
              avoid equal ownership structures in future ventures.
              <br /><br />
              Today, I am doing my MBA at Columbia University in the Value
              Investing Program - a cohort of 40 students selected to
              concentrate on this field. My long-term goal is to run 1) a public
              value portfolio, 2) private venture portfolio, and 3) an operating
              business under one roof called the DSK Group. I do this today at a
              small scale, but hope to make it more formal one day.

              The curtains are closing on my 20s, and I'm looking forward to
              what my 30s will bring. I hope to have more adventurous stories
              for you then. Until next time.

          <h3>Nest Wallet</h3>
          <p>
            A multi-signature crypto wallet that can be secured through multiple
            devices (mobile, browser extension, ledger). 1st place from over 100
            projects in the 1-month long Safe hackathon cohosted by Coinbase and
            Stripe. <br /><br />
            <strong>Features:</strong> The multisig wallet could connect to any
            dapp, similar to Metamask, through the Nest browser extension. It
            was built on top of the Safe protocol, which custodies over $100
            billion in assets, and incorporated best-in-class UX with in-app
            security checks, swap and other transaction capabilities. You can
            also launch both individual and multisig wallets on dozens of EVM
            chains with a few clicks from the mobile app.

          <p>
            <strong>Task:</strong> A cryptocurrency price tracker built for my
            2-day MVP project in Hack Reactor. Built using Coingecko's API.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Build:</strong> React, PostgreSQL, Node.js, Express. <br />
            <br />
            Note that "Comments" section does not work because github-pages (how
            this is deployed) does not allow hosting of database.

          <h3>Backend System Design</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Task:</strong> Built a backend API that could scale to web
            server level. Achieved 3000 requests / second and sub 50ms latency.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>Learnings:</strong> Using secondary indexes to optimize
            table lookup speeds from O(N) to O(logN), horizontally scaling
            servers with a load balancer and using a ELT process to load
            millions of lines of csv data into my table schema. Limitations were
            having to use free-tier t2 micro instances on AWS. <br /><br />
            The trickiest part was deploying, since there are so many finnicky
            parts in dev ops.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Build:</strong> NGINX, AWS EC2, PostgreSQL, loader.io
            (deployed testing) and k6 (local testing).

            environment. I made the "related products" section. <br /><br />
            <strong>Learnings:</strong> Using promise.all to make concurrent API
            calls, using local storage for storing user styles, and more CSS!
            <br /><br />
