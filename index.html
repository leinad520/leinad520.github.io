              Hi, I’m Daniel. Some call me Sangyoon. I was born in the U.S., but
              spent most of my life in South Korea 🇰🇷 and Singapore 🇸🇬, before
              returning stateside for college and work. <br /><br />
              I’ve spent my career across Wall Street, early-stage venture, and
              worked on two startups – one bootstrapped and one venture-backed,
              in addition to being a self-taught programmer. <br /><br />
              My path has revolved around two big curiosities in my life –
              investing and decentralized technologies. The first arose from
              taking a middle school summer camp class called "Who is Dow
              Jones?", where I fell in love with the art of investing 📚. I
              particularly appreciate that it rewards independent, even
              contrarian, thinking and an even temperament. One of my favorite
              books on this topic is
              <a
                href="https://www.amazon.com/Outsiders-Unconventional-Radically-Rational-Blueprint/dp/1422162672"
                target="_blank"
                >The Outsiders</a
              >. My second curiosity arose much later in life - decentralized
              technologies ₿. I write about both on my
              <a href="https://dksangyoon.substack.com" target="_blank"
                >Substack</a
              >. <br /><br />
              When I’m not going down rabbit-holes and writing, you can find me
              playing tennis 🎾 , golf ⛳ or poker with friends. When I’m alone,
              I love playing Chopin or movie soundtracks on the piano 🎹, though
              I need to really start learning some new pieces again. I enjoy
              trying new types of coffee ☕ (I was once a Starbucks barista in
              my teens), and try to be half-vegetarian, since I’m not brave
              enough to go full-on just yet. <br /><br />
              That’s a little bit about me.
              <br /><br />
              <strong
                >But if you’d like to learn the truth of my journey, I invite
                you to take the red pill and join me below… (Cheesy, I know, but
                hey, The Matrix is a great movie.)</strong
              >
            </p>

            <p style="margin-top: 1rem">
              My career started in New York City, where I had a brief stint in
              investment banking and a multi-manager hedge fund. In some ways, I
              was living the life – early 20s, in the heart of New York, living
              with two close friends, one who worked for a macro fund and
              another in private equity. We were finally earning enough to sip
              $8 juices guilt-free and would explore the most random hobbies
              together – hip hop dancing (where I’m sure the instructor gave up
              on us), boxing, or hosting friends at our den that had become a
              makeshift poker room. However, we also found ourselves chained to
              our desks on many weekends. I remember one weekend, my housemate
              and I went to the sauna at 24 Hour Fitness near home. We had
              worked on Saturday and wanted to taste freedom on our one free
              day, Sunday. I dipped in, relaxing in the steam and ready to
              continue our philosophical musings on life. Three minutes in, he
              rose. <br /><br />
              “You’re going already? We literally just got in.”
              <br /><br />
              “Sorry man, boss wants this checked tonight and ready by Monday
              morning.”
              <br /><br />
              It was almost comedic, I couldn’t even get upset. I still think
              that’s the only time I ever saw someone dip in a sauna for three
              minutes and call in a day. I joked that he had grinded his way
              through Harvard so that he could become an indentured servant. It
              was in the midst of this environment that I discovered
              cryptocurrencies.
              <br /><br />
              Long story short, I started arbitraging inefficient crypto markets
              <a
                href="https://medium.com/hackernoon/how-i-made-15-000-day-as-a-fresh-college-grad-74a87a80c253"

              </a>
              from our small NYC bedroom. This and other early investments made
              me a millionaire by my mid 20s. I was proud of myself. But then I
              quickly felt hollow. The best in the space were engaged in a
              movement, not just profiting off market inefficiencies. That was
              how I found myself in the Bay Area in 2018, at age 24, writing a
              book and making a crypto wiki to help people cut through the noise
              and understand why this technology mattered. Hundreds of projects
              with technical jargon were popping up every day, where even
              someone full-time like myself would get lost in it all.
              <br /><br />

              To me, crypto is an equalizing force - an open industry where
              people are judged on merit, creativity and contribution rather
              than status, and a technology that enables people to more
              equitably share in the wealth that innovation creates. Imagine
              every time you rode an Uber, you earned equity in the company.
              That's a small example of what crypto rails make possible. On
              Ethereum, you can access loans from a decentralized protocol with
              just an internet connection, not gated by income, ethnicity, or
              social status. With DePIN systems like Helium, I am both a
              consumer and owner in the mobile network I use.

              <br /><br />
              While building the wiki, it dawned on me that becoming a better
              programmer, but also helping more projects in the ecosystem, would
              help scale my impact faster. I tried a coding bootcamp called Hack
              Reactor in San Francisco, and breathed code 14 hours a day, Monday
              to Sunday. Then I dropped out.
              <br /><br />
              I was doing fine by all metrics, about middle of the pack, but was
              extremely frustrated with myself for being so… average. I remember
              friends and mentors from the batch crying, some angry, that I
              would choose to leave instead of pushing through. We had gotten
              very close to each other since we were practically caged together
              for those two months. In my immaturity, I couldn’t accept that I
              was just average, instead of being the technical wizard I had
              envisioned.
              <br /><br />
              Dejected, I aimlessly searched for a role for the next six months.
              By good fortune, mutual connections put me in touch with venture
              capitalist Tim Draper, and I joined him in investing in
              early-stage projects. I had respected him for being one of the
              first prominent figures to lend credibility to the space as early
              as 2014, and wanted to learn everything I could from him. We
              invested in early in projects like Arkham, Polymarket, Polygon,
              and Stacks, some of which would rise a hundredfold in a mere
              couple of years. Others, like Coinbase or Ledger, would continue
              to grow and become indispensable for the ecosystem. Interestingly,
              I felt simultaneously more involved and more left on the sidelines
              - a contradiction, I know. I missed being a player on the field.
              On nights and weekends, my computer would click-clack with
              attempts to get better at code-writing.
              <br /><br />
              Near the end of my time there, Tim asked me if I wanted to raise a
              crypto fund together that I could manage. By then, crypto had
              become mainstream, and big-name funds were reaching out, offering
              high six figure salaries to run crypto for them as a partner. It
              was very enticing. But I remembered the people I had let down, not
              least of all myself, in quitting the coding bootcamp. I didn’t
              want to leave that ark unfinished.
              <br /><br />
              I
              <a
                href="https://dksangyoon.substack.com/p/leaving-vc-coding-bootcamp-startup-55d94fb710ff"
                target="_blank"
                >redid the bootcamp
              </a>
              and graduated, after which some old friends convinced me to
              co-found a startup with them. One had sold his last startup to
              Bitgo, and was itching to do something new. I'd happily raise the
              funding, but on one condition - that I would work as a full-time
              software engineer.
              <br /><br />
              We initially built a marketplace connecting crypto gaming guilds
              to players that quickly amassed tens of thousands of players and
              all the top guilds like YGG and Ancient8. But the market turned,
              and the guilds went out of business, along with the players. After
              an unsuccessful pivot to a NFT events platform, we were out of
              energy, and felt we had one shot left. Having personally lost
              bitcoin to institutions that crashed in 2022, I hoped to build a
              product that could help people safeguard their crypto assets. This
              goes back to how the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, was intended
              to be stored: self-custodied, seizure-proof and
              censorship-resistant. I also saw that the Gnosis Safe multisig
              protocol was growing rapidly. That was how our
              <a href="https://nestwallet.xyz" target="_blank"
                >multi-signature crypto wallet</a
              >
              got started.
              <br /><br />
              We built a prototype in one month and won 1st place from over 100
              projects in a hackathon hosted by Safe, Coinbase and Stripe. This
              set us on our way. We got to a point where customers were excited
              about what we were building and had to decide whether to serve
              retail or enterprise users. Others were interested in acquiring
              the technology and have us build in-house. Ultimately, my
              co-founders wanted to target the retail market. I was so proud of
              all we had gone through together, but this was not where my
              passion lied. I made the difficult choice to step back, freeing up
              some equity for the team to hire others more passionate about the
              direction, and serve in an advisory capacity today, rooting for
              the team to fulfill their vision. See my

              And that’s a wrap! The curtains are closing on my 20s, and I’m
              looking forward to what my 30s will bring. I hope to have more
              adventurous stories for you then. Until next time.

          <h3>Nest Wallet</h3>
          <p>
            A multi-signature crypto wallet that can be secured through multiple
            devices (mobile, browser extension, ledger). 1st place from over 100
            projects in the 1-month long Safe hackathon cohosted by Coinbase and
            Stripe. <br /><br />
            <strong>Features:</strong> The multisig wallet could connect to any
            dapp, similar to Metamask, through the Nest browser extension. It
            was built on top of the Safe protocol, which custodies over $100
            billion in assets, and incorporated best-in-class UX with in-app
            security checks, swap and other transaction capabilities. You can
            also launch both individual and multisig wallets on dozens of EVM
            chains with a few clicks from the mobile app.

          <p>
            <strong>Task:</strong> A cryptocurrency price tracker built for my
            2-day MVP project in Hack Reactor. Built using Coingecko's API.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Build:</strong> React, PostgreSQL, Node.js, Express. <br />
            <br />
            Note that "Comments" section does not work because github-pages (how
            this is deployed) does not allow hosting of database.

          <h3>Backend System Design</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Task:</strong> Built a backend API that could scale to web
            server level. Achieved 3000 requests / second and sub 50ms latency.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>Learnings:</strong> Using secondary indexes to optimize
            table lookup speeds from O(N) to O(logN), horizontally scaling
            servers with a load balancer and using a ELT process to load
            millions of lines of csv data into my table schema. Limitations were
            having to use free-tier t2 micro instances on AWS. <br /><br />
            The trickiest part was deploying, since there are so many finnicky
            parts in dev ops.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Build:</strong> NGINX, AWS EC2, PostgreSQL, loader.io
            (deployed testing) and k6 (local testing).

            <strong>Task:</strong> Ecommerce website built following detailed
            client specs. Built with three other engineers in agile sprint
            environment. I made the "related products" section. <br /><br />
            <strong>Learnings:</strong> Using promise.all to make concurrent API
            calls, using local storage for storing user styles, and more CSS!
            <br /><br />
            <strong>Build:</strong> React, Express, Node.js, Amazon EC2.
